                <p className="paragraph">Creating a daily workout routine is intense, so prioritize rest and recovery. Hereâ€™s a daily workout plan for your goals, but remember rest days are crucial. Start with lighter weights, focusing on form, and gradually increase resistance. Listen to your body, and only increase the weight when you feel ready to do so. Hydration is essential for optimal performance; drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workouts to replenish fluids lost through sweat and keep your body performing at its best. Consistency and gradual progression lead to long-term results.</p>
